# In-process adaptive defect correction for robotic hybrid LAAM
### Summary
On-machine laser scanning and in-process adaptive dimension deviation (surface defect) correction strategy

- On-machine laser scanning measurement to generate point cloud data
- Point cloud processing
- Rapid surface defect identification
- Repair AM part surface defect based on point cloud data
- Automatic repairing AM toolpath generation

Currently in development:
