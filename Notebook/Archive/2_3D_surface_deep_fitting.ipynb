    "This notebook aims to estimate normal vectors and principal curvatures from 3D point clouds using classic PCA and Jet fitting methods as well as recent DeepFit method. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface normals and curvatures are a very important properties in shape analysis and are widely used in different fields like computer graphics, computer vision and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such features are useful for noise reduction, point cloud segmentation, and classification.\n",

    "### Mathematical Background\n",
    "3D point clouds are represented as a matrix of $(x, y, z)$ coordinates of points in 3D space. \n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with plane fitting and jets, this section provides a short background. For more in-depth information see the refrences at the bottom. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following methods share the following: \n",
    "* Input: 3D point cloud  + querry point $q_i$\n",
    "* Find $q_i$'s k nearest neighbors.  \n",
    "* Do something fancey :)\n",
    "* Output: Normal vector at  query point $N_{q_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating the normal at each point we use each point in the point cloud as the query point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PCA\n",
    "In this method we estimate the tangent plane to the underlying surface at the query point. This boils down to  solving the eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition of the covariance matrix created from the points nearest neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(p_i-\\hat{p})(p_i-\\hat{p})^T\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p_i$ are the neighboring points and $\\hat{p}$ is the neighbours centroid. \n",
    "The normal vector is the eugenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this method we cannot directly estimate the principal curvatures (the principal curvatures of a plane are 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jet fitting\n",
    "\n",
    " An $n$-jet of the height function over a surface is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f(x,y)=J_{\\beta,n}(x,y)= \\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\sum_{j=0}^{k}\\beta_{k-j,j}x^{k-j}y^j\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\beta$ is the jet coefficients vector that consists of $N_n=(n+1)(n+2)/2$ terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We require that every point satisfy the equation above, yielding the system of linear equations:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    M\\beta = B\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that the solution can be expressed in closed-form as: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\beta = (M^TM)^{-1}M^TB\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $M=(1, x_i, y_i, ..., x_i y_i^{n-1}, y_i^n)_{i=1,...,N_p}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_p \\times N_n}$ is the Vandermonde matrix and the height function vector $B=(z_1, z_2,...z_{N_p})^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^N_p$. Both represent the sampled points.\n"
